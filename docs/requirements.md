1. # Architecture & Scalability
Distributed: The task queue should support multiple worker nodes across different machines.
Horizontal Scaling: The system should scale by adding more worker nodes or task producers.
Fault-Tolerant: Ensure fault tolerance so that tasks are not lost during worker failure.
2. # Task Producers & Consumers
Producers: Clients can submit tasks to the queue.
Consumers (Workers): Distributed workers should be able to pull and execute tasks asynchronously.
Concurrency: Workers must handle tasks concurrently and efficiently.
3. # Task Management
Task Types: Support multiple task types, with flexible payloads (JSON, binary, etc.).
Task Prioritization: Optionally prioritize certain tasks over others.
Task Retry: Automatic retries on task failure with configurable backoff.
Task Timeout: Set a maximum execution time per task.
4. # Queue Operations
Push/Pop Tasks: Producers can push tasks to the queue, and workers pop tasks for execution.
Task Acknowledgement: Workers must acknowledge task completion to remove tasks from the queue.
Delayed Execution: Support for scheduling tasks to run after a specific delay.
Idempotency: Ensure tasks can be retried without duplicate execution in case of failure.
5. # Reliability
Persistence: Tasks must be persisted (e.g., in a database or message broker) to survive crashes.
Exactly-Once Delivery: Ensure that tasks are processed exactly once, or provide at-least-once guarantees with idempotent task execution.
6. # Monitoring & Management
Metrics: Provide metrics (e.g., task queue length, task processing time, etc.) for monitoring.
Logging: Workers should log task execution, failures, and retries.
Admin Interface: Basic interface or API for queue management (inspect queue, delete tasks, etc.).
7. # Concurrency & Load Balancing
Worker Concurrency: Workers should handle multiple tasks concurrently with configurable limits.
Load Balancing: Distribute tasks evenly across workers.
8. # Security
Authentication: Implement optional authentication for producers and workers.
Encryption: Ensure secure transmission of tasks between producer, queue, and workers (e.g., TLS).
9. # Extensibility
Pluggable Backends: Support different storage backends for the queue (e.g., Redis, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ).
Custom Worker Logic: Allow custom worker implementations to handle different types of tasks.
10. # Documentation & Testing
Documentation: Provide clear documentation for setting up and using the queue.
Testing: Ensure unit tests and integration tests cover core functionality (task submission, retries, etc.).
